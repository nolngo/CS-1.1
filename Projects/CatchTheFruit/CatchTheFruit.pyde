'''The setup() function is run once, when the program starts. 
It's used to define initial enviroment properties such as screen size and to load media such as images and fonts as the program starts. 
There can only be one setup() function for each program and it shouldn't be called again after its initial execution.'''

'''Called directly after setup(), the draw() function continuously 
executes the lines of code contained inside 
its block until the program is stopped or noLoop() is called. 
draw() is called automatically and should never be called explicitly. 
All Processing programs update the screen at the end of draw(), 
never earlier. The number of times draw() executes in each second 
may be controlled with the frameRate() function.'''
