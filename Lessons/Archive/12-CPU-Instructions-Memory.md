# CPU Instructions and Memory

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Identify the three functions of a computer's central processing unit: fetch, decode, and execute
- Differentiate parts of machine code instructions: opcode and operands
- Categorize programming operations into four instruction opcode types: arthmetic, logical, branch, and memory
- Identify differences between instruction operand addressing modes: immediate, direct, indirect, and indexed
- Appreciate performance improvements offered by CPU cache and virtual memory

## CPU Instructions and Memory
- Review major computer components from last lesson (3 min)
  - Motherboard and BIOS ROM
  - Random-access memory (RAM)
  - Central processing unit (CPU)
  - Graphics processing unit (GPU)
  - Disk drives and other I/O devices
- Review which components are connected to each other and how (2 min)
- Teacher talk and discussion following [CPU Instructions and Memory][slides] slides (40 min)

Break (5 min)

## Machine Code Programs
- Introduce activity on [CPU Instructions and Memory][worksheet] challenges worksheet (5 min)
- Draw diagram of CPU, RAM, accumulator, and program counter on whiteboard (5 min)
- I do: Teacher shows how to execute machine code in example program #1 on whiteboard (10 min)
- We do: Call on students to execute machine code in example program #2 on whiteboard (20 min)
- You do: Students execute machine code in challenge programs #1 and #2 individually (20 min)
