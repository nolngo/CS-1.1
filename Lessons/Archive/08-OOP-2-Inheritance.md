# Object-Oriented Programming Part 2: Inheritance

## [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19HYyz1AGeSLnHCxKNOOT7YEiKMbBLFf0QChq1-8TiVI/edit?usp=sharing)

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Appreciate why encapsulation and inheritance with OOP are useful in software design
- Map OOP concepts onto code structures and translate code into OOP terms
- Implement code utilizing classes, objects, properties, and methods
- Refactor repetitive code to use classes inheriting superclass behaviors
- Override methods inherited from superclass to customize subclass behaviors

## Encapsulation
- Teacher talk: Motivate how encapsulation helps program structure (5 min)
- Think, pair, share: Everyday examples of classes and objects (5 min)
- I do, we do, you do: Code examples that use classes and objects (30 min)
  - Defining a class: `class Tiger`
  - Instantiating an object: `tony = Tiger('Tony')`
  - Accessing a property: `tony.name`
  - Defining a method: `Tiger.eat(food)`
  - Calling a method: `tony.eat('fish')`

Break (5 min)

## Inheritance
- Teacher talk: How inheritance allows code reuse and customization (5 min)
- Think, pair, share: Examples of superclasses and subclasses (5 min)
- I do, we do, you do: Code examples that use class inheritance (30 min)
  - Defining a superclass: `class Animal`
  - Class inheritance: `class Tiger(Animal)` and `class Giraffe(Animal)`
  - Method overriding: `Giraffe.eat(food)`
  - Polymorphism: `animal.eat('meat')`
- Pair program on challenges listed below (25 min)
