# Herd Immunity Simulation

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Understand the concept of herd immunity for vaccinations
1. See how simulations can model how different viruses spread through a population  
1. Use automated tests to verify that program behavior is accurate

## Infectious Disease Modeling
- Watch video: [What Bill Gates is afraid of][Bills Fear] (5 min)
- Read and discuss: [How Ebola Compares to Other Infectious Diseases][Infectious Diseases] (15 min)
- Teacher Talk: Herd immunity, vaccinations, and simulations (20 min)
- Introduce [Herd Immunity Simulation Project][] (10 Min)

Break (5 min)

## Explore Herd Immunity Simulation Project
- Project Overview (10 min)
- Teacher Talk: Purpose of `Virus`, `Person`, `Simulator` and `Logger` (10 min)
- Pair program: Create new `Virus` test (10 min)
- Pair program: Complete three `Person` tests (20 min)


## Resources
- Vox's Video on [What Bill Gates is afraid of][Bills Fear]
- The Atlantic's [1918 Flu Epidemic](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/04/what-bill-gates-fears-most/559007/)
- The Guardian's article on [Infectious Diseases]

## Challenges
- [Herd Immunity Simulation Project][]
  - Implement `Virus` and `Person` classes and write unit tests

## Stretch Challenges
- Create `Visualizer` class that shows spread of virus based on log files
- Extend functionality to model multiple viruses spreading through population at the same time.
