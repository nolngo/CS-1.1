# Computer Components & Organization

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Identify major components in desktop computers and explain their function
- Diagram which computer components are connected to each other and how
- Articulate differences between volatile memory and persistent storage
- Appreciate the impact of Moore's law on computer power, size, and cost

## Computer Components
- Teacher talk and discussion following [Components and Organization][slides] slides interlaced with activities below (60 min)
- List names of major components that are inside a desktop computer (3 min)
- Compare your list with classmates, add more components to your list (2 min)
- Make a master list of components on the whiteboard from the whole class (5 min)
- Draw diagram of which components are connected to each other and how (5 min)
- Compare diagram representations with classmates, discuss any differences (5 min)

Break (5 min)

## Moore's Law
- Time travel: Evolution and advancement of personal computers since 1976 (20 min)
- Identify how RAM chips became smaller in size yet larger in capacity through time
- Calculate RAM chip storage capacity through the decades: 1990, 2000, 2010, 2020
- Demonstrate recent miniaturized computers that outpower PCs from decades prior
