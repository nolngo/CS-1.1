# OOP Design Challenge

In this assignment we will apply everything we have learned to design classes and objects that could be used to build a a game, application, or other system!

You can use any idea you like as long as it fulfills [the rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZO1IFBUdnVHqUd4Yt4MrPUtnY08oVElU8D2-vO6PdW8/copy), but if you have trouble coming up with ideas an example will be given that you can use.

**For this assignment you will need to complete the following requirements:**  

- At least four classes are defined
- Each class has a least 2 properties created in __init__()
- Each class has at least 2 methods that use and/or modify class properties
- All classes are used to instantiate example objects
- Rationale about which properties and methods are made private, protected, or public is provided in code comments or verbally in presentation
- At least one class demonstrates composition (being composed of other objects)
- A diagram is provided that shows an overview of all the classes that make up the system design
- Diagram shows relationships between classes
- At least one class inherits from another class
- The subclass overrides at least one superclass method (this can be __init__ or another method)
- 5 - 10 min demo presentation is given showing off all of the above requirements

Note: The goal of this project is to design classes and instantiate example objects that would be used in your game or app. **It is not to design an entire working game or app**, if you would like to do this as a stretch goal feel free, but it is not required.  


**When you are finished submit a link to your code on Gradescope, your demo presentation will be given in class. If you can not make the presentation day then you may turn in a video presentation to me via Slack**

## Example Idea

You are creating a fruit catch game similar to the one shown [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyDcrK7myec)

You game will need to have multiple fruits each with different falling speeds, images, and point values. There will also be a special power up fruit that lets the basket move faster for a limited duration of time. In addition to the fruits occasionally a rotten fruit will fall that if caught will subtract points rather than add them. You will also need to have a basket that can move and catch fruits. You will need to have some sort of game controller that makes fruits and keeps track of the time and score. The game ends when the timer is up. 

## Stretch Challenges

- Demonstrate Overloading
- Demonstrate Abstract Classes
- Demonstrate Static Methods
- Demonstrate Decorators
- Demonstrate Multiple Inheritance
- Demonstrate Mix In's
- Use you classes you made to build a prototype with an interface and user interaction
